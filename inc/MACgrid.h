 *      Marker-And-Cell  (MAC) grid. This file is used to store simulation variables in an organized manner.
 *      Properties of interest are stored in the center of the grid cell, while the components of the velocity
 *      field are stored on the half indices.
 *
 *      ...    |                |    |   ...
 *      ...____|__v(i,j+1/2,k)__|____|___...
 *      ...    |      	        |    |   ...
 *      ...	   |    P(i,j,k)    |    |   ...
 *      ...    |      	        |    |   ...
 * 		...____|__v(i,j-1/2,k)__|____|___...
 * 		...    |                |    |   ...
 *
 * 		So the MAC grid theoretically is numbered using half indices (as shown above for one of the three dimensions), however
 * 		for ease of code naming we will always round up. So the first element of the v array would be on the bottom edge of our
 * 		MAC grid.
 *
 *		...    |                |    |   ...
 *      ...____|__v(i,j+1,k)____|____|___...
 *      ...    |      	        |    |   ...
 *      ...	   |    P(i,j,k)    |    |   ...
 *      ...    |      	        |    |   ...
 * 		...____|__v(i,j,k)______|____|___...
 *      ...    |                |    |   ...
 *
 * 		In other words accessing the pressure and all of the velocity components around it would look something like this:
 *
 * 					v(i,j+1,k)
 * 		u(i,j,k)	p(i,j,k)		u(i+1,j,k)
 * 					v(i,j,k)
 *
 * 		Where the w component would be into the screen. ie- w(1,1,0) would be closest to your face, and w(1,1,1) would be
 * 		closer to the screen.
